[00:02.82] Turn up the volume
[00:05.48] Boost up your mood and

[00:19.39] 
[00:10.40] Just be yourself now
[00:13.33] Yeah, yeah, just like that
[00:15.66] Lights and camera, action
[00:28.16] 
[00:18.96] Look right into
[00:21.09] My zoom lens shooting you
[00:24.82] A bit right
[00:26.78] And chin in
[00:27.78] Now tell me all of your specs
[00:42.28] 
[00:33.76] Don't look so shy now
[00:36.33] Don't be embarrassed
[00:38.83] And walk with some conviction too

[01:05.48] On the underside
[01:10.81] To know everything
[01:12.97] Face front and look outside
[01:26.47] 
[01:35.70] Now move your gaze
[01:38.05] Just a little away
[01:41.34] A bit up
[01:43.55] Keep it there
[01:44.77] It will end soon, so hang in there
[02:01.77] 
[01:49.17] There is nothing true
[01:51.44] On the underside
[01:56.77] To know everything
[01:59.07] Face front and look outside
[02:12.57] 
[02:21.18] You've got all our eyes
[02:26.83] Don't look away
[02:28.83] You've got all our eyes
[02:34.58] Never look away
[02:42.08] 
[02:36.36] You've had a hard day
[02:39.32] But now it's over
[02:41.47] And everything here is all through
[02:58.47] 
[02:44.02] Turn off the TV
[02:46.56] Come on, take me out
[02:49.00] Let's go dancing, Saturday night
[03:05.00]

[03:12.87] 
[03:04.43] Let's go dancing, Saturday night
