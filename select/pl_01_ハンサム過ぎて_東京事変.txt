Turn up the volume
Boost up your mood and
Show us what you can do
Just be yourself now
Yeah, yeah, just like that
Lights and camera, action
Look right into
My zoom lens shooting you
A bit right
And chin in
Now tell me all of your specs
Don't look so shy now
Don't be embarrassed
And walk with some conviction too
We'll all be famous
In our lives one time
For fifteen minutes, no more
These are your lights
This whole set is for you
Commercial
Avenue
You are a handsome young fellow
There is nothing true
On the underside
To know everything
Face front and look outside
Now move your gaze
Just a little away
A bit up
Keep it there
It will end soon, so hang in there
There is nothing true
On the underside
To know everything
Face front and look outside
You've got all our eyes
Don't look away
You've got all our eyes
Never look away
You've had a hard day
But now it's over
And everything here is all through
Turn off the TV
Come on, take me out
Let's go dancing Saturday night
Let's go dancing Saturday night
Let's go dancing Saturday night
